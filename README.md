# Dotfiles
All of my personal dotfiles. Each branch is its own dotfile system. If you are confused about what branch has what dotfiles then the name of each branch is beside what it belongs to. All Window's dotfiles have an install script, `Install-<Branch>.ps1`, that needs to be ran where you want the dotfiles to build from. All other systems are just one clone away.

## Portable *(winable)*
> [!NOTE]
> You need to run `Install-Winable.ps1` after cloning. You also need to be in the Directory where you want the folders to build.

My version of a portable work drive. Currently I have this on a 32GB Flash Drive, formated as NTFS.
