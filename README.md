# Dotfiles
All of my personal dotfiles. Each branch is its own dotfile system. If you are confused about what branch has what dotfiles then the name of each branch is beside what it belongs to. All Window's dotfiles have an install script, `Install-<Branch>.ps1`, that needs to be ran where you want the dotfiles to build from. All other systems are just one clone away.

## Portable *(winable)*
TODOs
- [X] Update and/or Change Environment Variables
- [X] Edit and Change Modules path to .\\.conf\powershell\modules
- [X] Read and automaticly run ps1 files in .\scripts
- [ ] Create needed Alias

My version of a portable work drive. Currently I have this on a 32GB Flash Drive, formated as NTFS.
